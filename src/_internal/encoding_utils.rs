/// version of this struct. The reason this struct exists then, is because
/// anything that pushes to a vec checks to make sure there is enough capacity.
/// That cost is probably negligible, but added up could be noticeable
/// (especially in hot loops), and if you can guarantee you know / can calculate
/// the exact amount you need, then allocate it all up front, you no longer need
/// those checks, so why even bother running those checks?
///
/// With debug assertions enabled, this struct will keep track of the amount of
/// bytes written and assert unsafe preconditions, like not overflowing the
/// allocated capacity, as well as having all preallocated capacity filled.
/// However, with debug assertions off (release mode has it off by default),
/// these checks are not run (the `bytes_written` field that tracks it is
/// gated behind `cfg(debug_assertions)`, so doesn't even exist!), and it becomes
/// essentially just a wrapper around a vec, its ptr, raw ptr copying operations,
/// and a method that unsafely sets the len of the vec before unwrapping it.

	/// the len of the vec to the initially requested amount of capacity, which
	/// the caller of that method promises is initialised, since it is a safety
