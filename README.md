# wiwi

A (not so) lil lib containing many things and Stuff&trade; (some useful, some silly), intending to serve as an "extended standard library" of sorts. Maybe even can serve as a replacement for `std` eventually, for some applications (we'll see!).

## Platform support

This crate will only _officially_ support macOS and Linux. Windows support will only be on best effort basis. This does not mean I don't want to support Windows though! Just that my ability to do so is going to be lesser than unix platforms. Still do submit issues though, and you can PR me if you'd like!
