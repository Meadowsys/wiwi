# wiwi

A lil lib containing misc utilities, and Stuffâ„¢. Contains some useful things, contains some silly things.

All exposed features are gated behind features, none of which are enabled by default.

**Unstable features are not covered by semver guarantee.** You must also enable the `unstable` feature to make use of these features.

## Features

<!-- make sure to check Cargo.toml and workflow files too -->

- **`clock-timer-2`** - An interval tracking clock, yielding ticks at specified intervals and doing so for a specified duration. **Requires an async runtime**
- **`debounce`** - Delay calling a function until a certain time period has passed since the last time it was called. **Requires an async runtime**
- **`h`** - h
- **`hex`** - Fast (faster than `hex` crate[^1]) implementation of hex encoding, supporting upper hex and lower hex.
- **`lazy-wrap`** - Wrapper around an initialisation function to lazily initialise a value on first access (can be used in statics)
- **`lsl`** (unstable) - experimental lib to help with writing Second Life scripts in Rust... because yes, I got fed up with it very quickly and immediately missed Rust lol
- **`serialiser`** (unstable) - self describing, stable (once finished) binary serialiser, aiming for small output size by exploiting common patterns in real world data
- **`string-pool`** - Global immutable string pool and String type
- **`z85`** - A fast (faster than `z85` crate[^2]) implementation of [ZeroMQ]'s [z85] format, a format to represent binary data as printable ASCII text. Think base64, but more efficient in encoded size. This implementation is not fully to spec, as it handles padding text to the correct length where the spec says the application code must handle it instead.

### Addon features

These features enable things specific to 3rd-party crates and features you have enabled. For example, the `hashbrown` feature, when the `serialiser` feature is enabled, will implement `Serialise` and `Deserialise` traits for structs in `hashbrown`.

- **`hashbrown`**
- **`image`**
- **`serde-json`**

### Async runtime features

Only one can be enabled at a time. utility implementations for **`tokio`** will be prioritised over other runtimes, if/when they are added.

- **`tokio`** - Currently the only available runtime.

### Feature configuration features

These don't change the exposed API or program behaviour at all, only some internal implementation details that might affect things such as compile times, performance, and binary size.

- **`debounce-dyn-fn`** - Wraps functions into a `Box<dyn Fn>`, rather than monomorphising. This will cause calls to the underlying function (not the returned one) to be a bit slower than static dispatch, but also reduces the binary size depending on how many different concrete types the debounce functions are called with.

[^1]: Based on the benchmark available in this repo: wiwi is about 21.5x faster in encode, and 7.5x faster in decode. I want better benchmarks though. For now the `hex` crate also provides more flexibility, whereas `wiwi::hex` just exposes `encode_hex`, `encode_upper_hex`, and `decode_hex` functions.
[^2]: Based on the benchmark available in this repo: wiwi is about 1.4x faster in encode, and 2.2x faster in decode. I want better benchmarks though. There is no functionality that the `z85` crate provides, that we don't also provide (`encode_z85` and `decode_z85` functions).
