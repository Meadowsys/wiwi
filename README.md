# wiwi

A lil lib containing misc utilities, and Stuffâ„¢. Contains some useful things, contains some silly things.

All exposed features are gated behind features, none of which are enabled by default.

## Features

<!-- make sure to check Cargo.toml and workflow files too -->

- `clock-timer` - Async struct that yields ticks at specified intervals and for a specified duration. **Requires an async runtime**
- `debounce` - Delay calling a function until a certain time period has passed since the last time it was called. **Requires an async runtime**
- `h` - h
- `lazy-wrap` - Wrapper around an initialisation function to lazily initialise a value on first access (can be used in statics)
- `string-pool` - Global immutable string pool and String type

### Async runtime features

Only one can be enabled at a time. `tokio` will be prioritised over the others, if/when they are added.

- `tokio` - Currently the only available runtime.

### Feature configuration features

These don't change API usage, only some compile time behaviour under the hood.

- `debounce-dyn-fn` - Wraps functions into a `Box<dyn Fn>`, to use dynamic dispatch and avoid monomorphisation binary size cost
